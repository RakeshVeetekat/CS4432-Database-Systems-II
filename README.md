# CS4432-Database-Systems-II

This repo contains projects from the CS4432.

Project 2 required the creation of a simple index structure to speed up the performance of lookup queries.

Project 3 looks at the creation of database operators, such as join and aggregation, and then uses them to answer a SQL query.
