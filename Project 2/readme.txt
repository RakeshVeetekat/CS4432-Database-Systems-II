Section 1: Steps to compile

	1. Bring up the command terminal and navigate to the src folder for this project.
	2. Compile the Main.java class with "javac Main.java".
	3. Type in the command "java -jar Main.jar x" and replace x with the number of frames that you want to run the program with.
	
Section 2: Working sections

	The only section that does not work is the range-based query lookup. All of the other sections work correctly.
	
Section 3: Design Decisions
	
	I have not created any additional design decisions that do not adhere to the project.
